Write a code to define a relativistic *boost* function, that will take an input velocity vector and
a frame vector and will then output the velocity vector in the new frame. For a consider an observer (Curie) 
moving with velocity of (0.7,0,0) relative to Einstein. What velocity does she see for objects that 
Einstein measures to move at (0.3,0,0), (0,0.4,0) and (0.5,0.5,0), where all velocities are in units of c.
